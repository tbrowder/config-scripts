Build Your Own OpenStreetMap Tile Server on Ubuntu 16.04
Last Updated: December 8, 2018 Xiao Guo An (Admin) 58 Comments
Linux Server

OpenStreetMap, aka OSM, is a user contributed world map that is freely
editable. This tutorial will show you how to build your own
OpenStreetMap tile server on Ubuntu 16.04. 4GB RAM, 40GB disk space
should be the minimum OpenStreetMap server requirements for displaying
a small country map like UK. If your map is large, then consider
adding more RAM and disk space. If you need to do this on a VPS, then
I recommend Linode, from which you can get a 4GB VPS for only 20 USD
per month. Without further ado, let's get started.

Step 1: Upgrade Software
------------------------

  sudo apt update

  sudo apt upgrade

Step 2: Install PostgreSQL Database Server with PostGIS
-------------------------------------------------------

We will use PostgreSQL to store map data. PostGIS is a geospatial
extenstion to PostgreSQL. Run the following commands to install them.

  sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgis \
    postgresql-9.5-postgis-2.2

The postgres user will be created on the OS during the installation
process. It's the super user for PostgreSQL database server. By
default, this user has no password and there's no need to set one
because you can use sudo to switch to the postgres user:

  sudo -u postgres -i

Now you can create a PostgreSQL database user osm.

  createuser osm

Create a database named gis and at the same time make osm as the owner
of the database. -E UTF8 specifies the character encoding scheme to be
used in the database is UTF8.

  createdb -E UTF8 -O osm gis

Create hstore and postgis extension on the gis database.

  psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION hstore;" -d gis

  psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;" -d gis

Exit from the postgres user.

  exit

Create the osm user on your operating system so the tile server can run as
the osm user.

  sudo adduser osm

Step 3: Download Map Stylesheet and Map Data
--------------------------------------------

First switch to the osm user

  sudo -u osm -i

Download the latest CartoCSS map stylesheets to the osm user’s home
directory.

  wget https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/archive/v2.41.0.tar.gz

Extract it.

  tar -xvzf v2.41.0.tar.gz

Next, download map data to the osm user's home directory. Use the
below command to download the map data of the whole planet (32G).

  wget -c http://planet.openstreetmap.org/pbf/planet-latest.osm.pbf

If you want a map of individual country or state, go to
http://download.geofabrik.de. Also, BBBike.org provides extracts of
more than 200 cities and regions world-wide in different formats.

For example, download the map data of Great Britain (847M).

  wget -c http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain-latest.osm.pbf

Now exit from the osm user.

  exit

Recommendations before Importing Map Data

Importing map data takes a lot of RAM. If your physical memory is
small, you can easily add a swap file. First we use fallocate command
to create a file. For example, create a file named swapfile with 2G
capacity in root file system:

  sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile

Then make sure only root can read and write to it.

  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

Format it to swap:

  sudo mkswap /swapfile

Output:

  Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 2097148 KiB
  no label, UUID=h32b3e10-0779-4865-9ea0-6e2af8f3kea9

Enable the swap file

  sudo swapon /swapfile

The import process can take some time. It's recommended to configure
SSH keepalive so that you don't lose the SSH connection. It's very
easy to do. Just open the SSH client configuration file on your local
Linux machine.

  sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config

And paste the following text at the end of the file.

  ServerAliveInterval 60

Then save the file and connect to your Ubuntu 16.04 server

Step 4: Import the Map Data to PostgreSQL
-----------------------------------------

To import map data, we need to install osm2pgsql which converts
OpenStreetMap data to postGIS-enabled PostgreSQL databases.

  sudo aptitude install osm2pgsql

Switch to osm user again.

  sudo -u osm -i

Run the following command to load the map stylesheet and map data into
the gis Database. Replace great-britain-latest.osm.pbf with your own
map data file.

  osm2pgsql --slim -d gis -C 3600 --hstore \
     -S openstreetmap-carto-2.41.0/openstreetmap-carto.style \
     planet-latest.osm.pbf

osm2gpsql will run in slim mode which is recommended over the normal
mode. The '-d' is short for '--database'. The '-C' flag specifys the
cache size in MB. Bigger cache size results in faster import speed but
you need to have enough RAM to use cache. The '-S' flag specifies the
style file. And, finally, you need to specify the map data file.

Once the import is complete, exit from the osm user.

  exit

Step 5: Install mod_tile
------------------------

'mod_tile' is an Apache module that is required to serve
tiles. Currently no binary package is available for Ubuntu. We can
compile it from Github repository.

First install build dependencies.

  sudo apt install git autoconf libtool libmapnik-dev apache2-dev

Then clone the repository from Github.

  git clone https://github.com/openstreetmap/mod_tile.git

  cd mod_tile/

Compile and install

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo make install-mod_tile

COMPLETED ABOVE AS OF 2020-07-03 (except for import of
  North America started mid-day yesterday and still
  running on dedi10)

Step 6: Generate Mapnik Stylesheet
----------------------------------

Install required packages.

  sudo apt install curl unzip gdal-bin mapnik-utils # node-carto

[for Debian]

  install nodejs (see bash helper script)


Switch to the osm user.

  su - osm

Cd into the carto style directory.

  cd openstreetmap-carto-2.41.0/

Get shapefiles.

  ./get-shapefiles.sh

Now build the Mapnik xml stylesheet.

  carto project.mml > style.xml

Exit from the osm user.

  exit

Step 7: Configuring renderd
---------------------------

Edit renderd config file.

  sudo nano /usr/local/etc/renderd.conf

In the [default] section, change the value of XML and HOST to the following.

  XML=/home/osm/openstreetmap-carto-2.41.0/style.xml
  HOST=localhost

In [mapnik] section, change the value of plugins_dir.

  plugins_dir=/usr/lib/mapnik/3.0/input/

Save the file.

Install renderd init script by copying the sample init script.

  sudo cp mod_tile/debian/renderd.init /etc/init.d/renderd

Grant execute permission.

  sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/renderd

Edit the init script file

  sudo nano /etc/init.d/renderd

Change the following variable.

  DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/$NAME
  DAEMON_ARGS="-c /usr/local/etc/renderd.conf"
  RUNASUSER=osm

Save the file.

Create the following file and set osm the owner.

  sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/mod_tile

  sudo chown osm:osm /var/lib/mod_tile

Then start renderd service

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload

  sudo systemctl start renderd

  sudo systemctl enable renderd

Step 8: Configure Apache
------------------------

Install Apache web server

  sudo apt install apache2

Create a module load file.

  sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-available/mod_tile.load

Paste the following line into the file.

  LoadModule tile_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_tile.so

Create a symlink.

  sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/mod_tile.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/

Then edit the default virtual host file.

  sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

Paste the following lines in <VirtualHost *:80>

  LoadTileConfigFile /usr/local/etc/renderd.conf
  ModTileRenderdSocketName /var/run/renderd/renderd.sock
  # Timeout before giving up for a tile to be rendered
  ModTileRequestTimeout 0
  # Timeout before giving up for a tile to be rendered that is otherwise missing
  ModTileMissingRequestTimeout 30

Save and close the file. Restart Apache.

  sudo systemctl restart apache2

Then in your web browser address bar, type

  your-server-ip/osm_tiles/0/0/0.png

You should see the tile of world map. Congrats! You just successfully
built your own OSM tile server.

Display Your Tiled Web Map

Tiled web map is also known as slippy map in OpenStreetMap
terminology. There are two free and open source JavaScript map
libraries you can use for your tile server: OpenLayer and Leaflet. The
advantage of Leaflet is that it is simple to use and your map will be
mobile-friendly.

OpenLayer

To display your slippy map with OpenLayer, download JavaScript and CSS
from openlayer.org and extract it to the web root folder.

  cd /var/www/html

  sudo wget https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/releases/download/v4.3.4/v4.3.4.zip

  sudo unzip v4.3.4.zip

Next, create the index.html file.

  sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html

Paste the following HTML code in the file. Replace red-colored text
and adjust the longitude, latitude and zoom level according to your
needs.

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Accessible Map</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://your-ip/v4.3.4/css/ol.css" type="text/css">
  <script src="http://your-ip/v4.3.4/build/ol.js"></script>
  <style>
    a.skiplink {
      position: absolute;
      clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
      padding: 0;
      border: 0;
      height: 1px;
      width: 1px;
      overflow: hidden;
    }
    a.skiplink:focus {
      clip: auto;
      height: auto;
      width: auto;
      background-color: #fff;
      padding: 0.3em;
    }
    #map:focus {
      outline: #4A74A8 solid 0.15em;
    }
  </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a class="skiplink" href="#map">Go to map</a>
    <div id="map" class="map" tabindex="0"></div>
    <button id="zoom-out">Zoom out</button>
    <button id="zoom-in">Zoom in</button>
    <script>
      var map = new ol.Map({
        layers: [
          new ol.layer.Tile({
            source: new ol.source.OSM({
               url: 'http://your-ip/osm_tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
            })
         })
       ],
       target: 'map',
       controls: ol.control.defaults({
          attributionOptions: /** @type {olx.control.AttributionOptions} */ ({
            collapsible: false
          })
       }),
      view: new ol.View({
         center: [244780.24508882355, 7386452.183179816],
         zoom:5
      })
   });

    document.getElementById('zoom-out').onclick = function() {
      var view = map.getView();
      var zoom = view.getZoom();
      view.setZoom(zoom - 1);
    };

    document.getElementById('zoom-in').onclick = function() {
       var view = map.getView();
       var zoom = view.getZoom();
       view.setZoom(zoom + 1);
    };
  </script>
  </body>
  </html>

Save and close the file. Now you can view your slippy map by typing
your server IP address in browser.

  your-ip/index.html           or          your-ip

Leaflet

To display your slippy map with Leftlet, download JavaScript and CSS
from leftletjs.com and extract it to the web root folder.

  cd /var/www/html/

  sudo wget http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v1.2.0/leaflet.zip

  sudo unzip leaflet.zip

Next, create the index.html file.

  sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html

Paste the following HTML code in the file. Replace red-colored text
and adjust the longitude, latitude and zoom level according to your
needs.

  <html>
  <head>
  <title>My first osm</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="leaflet.css"/>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="leaflet.js"></script>
  <style>
     #map{width:100%;height:100%}
  </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="map"></div>
    <script>
      var map = L.map('map').setView([53.555,9.899],5);
      L.tileLayer('http://your-ip/osm_tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',{maxZoom:18}).addTo(map);
  </script>
  </body>
  </html>

Save and close the file. Now you can view your slippy map by typing
your server IP address in browser.

  your-ip/index.html           or          your-ip

openstreetmap tile server setup

To pre-render tiles instead of rendering on the fly, use render_list
command. Pre-rendered tiles will be cached in /var/lib/mod_tile
directory. -z and -Z flag specify the zoom level.

  render_list -m default -a -z 0 -Z 10

    Hi, first of all, thanks for the tutorial, it`s great.

    One question, can you update the tutorial or explain how can we make a self updating OSM tile server so that each day, or each week the map will be updated with the latest changes that appeared in OSM, similar with what OSM site it`s doing now, where if you edit, in 5 minutes you will be able to see the changes.

    Thank-you for your recipe! Unfortunately, I’m still running into frustrations with mod_tile .. I had to apt remove g++ to resolve one set of errors, had to apt install libpixman-1-0 to address a second set of errors, and now ‘make’ in mod_tile is giving me libtool warnings and an error, “cannot find the library ‘/home/travis/build/mapbox/mason/mason_packages/linux-x86_64/pixman/0.32.6/lib/libpixman-1.la’ or unhandled argument ‘/home/travis/build/mapbox/mason/mason_packages/linux-x86_64/pixman/0.32.6/lib/libpixman-1.la'”

    No idea who travis is, or why his homedir is hardcoded into a path somewhere 🙂

    Any thoughts on what I might do? Or should I run your recipe from a brand-new 16.04 install and hope for better luck?

        Hi, in the mod_tiles source directory there’s a hidden file named .travis.yml. Maybe you should check it out. And this tutorial is tested on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 install.

    Hi, Great tutorial! I was able to load in a small .pbf and serve the tiles to my leaflet viewer. I want to add another .pbf to my server and so I tried just doing the osm2pgsql line of Step-4 again, but with the new .pbf file. However when I restart the server (i.e. reboot the virtualmachine that is running it) I don’t see my knew area on the map, just the original one. Is there something else I need to do to load in new tiles?

    Thanks!

    *EDIT*

    Actually I can see it now. I just had to zoom in and wait for a bit so the renderd service could process the request for the new area I was looking at.

    Thank you Mr: Gouan, this is the most comprehensive and up to date tutorial i have seen, I think should be published in the OpenStreet site. The instructions there are outdated and truly not anybody is going to install in Ubuntu, but it gives an accurate idea of what it takes to set it up.
    If you let me give you a couple suggestions, i think the swap area setting must come starting step 4, and for the sake of precision, it will be nice to add an instruction to exit osm user at the end of step 6.

                I had the same problem. After investigating I found out that after the installation of mod_tile, its shared libraries were not yet registered correctly to the system. Run “sudo service renderd status” to check what is going wrong and also take a look into /var/log/syslog. In my case libiniparser.so.3 was not found by renderd. Simply running “sudo ldconfig” fixed it. After restarting renderd via “sudo service renderd restart” the error disappeared and everything was working as expected.

    Hello,
    followed your tutorial and was able to install my tile server nickel, thank you very much.
    I wonder if I can install gisgraphy along with the tile server, because I need geocoding and reverse gecocoding services.
    I found this tutorial http://stevenyue.com/blogs/install-gisgraphy-on-ubuntu-12-04-from-scratch/
    but I wonder if it’s valid for Ubuntu 16.
    Any advice on how to proceed since tile server is already in production.

    Thank you again

    Loving the tutorial. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get this working. 🙁 Any tile request create following debug note in the apache errorlog. debug: init_storage_backend: initialising file storage backend at: /var/lib/mod_tile
    I get a 404 when I request the test tile. The requested URL /osm_tiles/0/0/0.png was not found on this server.

    I redid your tutorial and did a writeup
    myself. http://wordpress-dbauszus.rhcloud.com/osm-tileserver-on-a-vanilla-ubuntu-16-04-droplet/

Thanks so much for breaking ground on Ubuntu 16.04… One question though. I was not able to have renderd starting when I reboot my server. Is this working for you? Do you have any ideas what I might have done wrong.

        I encountered the same problem before I wrote this tutorial. I fixed it, however I don’t remember what exactly caused this problem. I think you should check out your system log to see what is wrong.

    I made it way EASIER to create a local tileserver! Just use my docker image:

        Same problem. I realized that I had a typo when I was writing the configuration files. I recommend you to check the status of renderd.

    Thank you for your tutorial!

    Unfortunately I am having a problem where renderd I guess does not create the osm_files directory. I don’t know why, but I get a “Not Found” error when I check localhost/osm_tiles/0/0/0.png

    I have a world map download on an Azure VM with 16cores, 112GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD disk space.

    You can check it at http://medalbgis.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com

    Can you please offer some help? Or should I try with smaller maps? I got the same problem when I tried with the map of Albania for the first time and thought that maybe the map was incomplete or something, I don’t even know… But I keep getting the same issue with the global map so…

    Please help!

    Btw, Happy New Year 2018

    Hi,
    Is it possible to generate data in another EPSG eg 2180: EPSG? If in style, change srs to +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=19 +k=0.9993 +x_0=500000 +y_0=-5300000 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs, renderd return “Unknown projection string, using web mercator as never the less”. I’m using tutorial from swich2osm fro ubuntu 16.04.
    Greetings from Poland.

    Great tutorial, worked from 1st run!
    i wonder if there’s a way to modify the style the tiles are rendered with, and if so what is the process to follow? are there any samples that can be tried?
    Thanks a lot 🙂

    how would one update the tile server using the osm.pbf files?

    All the tutorials seems to stray away from the way that it was built in this tutorial.

        I have this same question, Gareth. When I went through this tutorial, I only used one state’s osm.pbf file and had no issues rendering a map for that state. When I went back through step 4 of the tutorial to import map data from a second state into PostgreSQL, I was unable to render a map for that state. There has to be a way to update or import additional maps?

    With this great tutorial it was possible to run an own OSM server.
    After the update from Ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04 the rendering process was not working anymore with the following error: socket connect failed for: /var/run/renderd/renderd.sock
    Any experiences with this effect?

    Thanks in advance.
