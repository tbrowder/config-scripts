Now using the acme clients at:

  https://kristaps.bsd.lv/acme-client/

Github source

  https://github.com/kristapsdz/acme-client-portable

Versions:
  libressl-2.5.5
  libbsd-0.8.6.tar.xz
  acme-client-portable-0.1.16

======================================

  install prereqs below

  configure some files

    see the README.md on the github site
    (https://github.com/kristapsdz/acme-client-portable), but that
    info is NOT in the source directory, issue files on github

From the README.md on configuration:

  In the latter [config.h] , you can set the NOBODY_USER value to be
  the name of an unprivileged user for privilege dropping. You can
  also set DEFAULT_CA_FILE for the location of the certificate file
  loaded by libtls. There's also PATH_VAR_EMPTY, which should be an
  empty directory into which we can create our jail.

  changes required in config.h for my installation:

    #define PATH_VAR_EMPTY "/var/acme-client/chroot"
    #define DEFAULT_CA_FILE "/usr/local/etc/ssl/cert.pem"

Requires (for Linux):
