Procedures for installing Apache2
=================================

NOTE:

The information in this directory applies specifically to installation
from source on a Debian 11 Bullsye amd64 host. Apache2 is not
well-documented and, while these instructions work for me, your
mileage may vary.

Pre-installation preparation:
----------------------------

Ensure you have the necessary Debian packages:

  as root execute bash script:
    $ sudo ./install-debian-bullsye-apache2-prereqs.sh

One more prerequisite is the Raku programming language. If you know
you have it, you are all set. Otherwise, you can install the Debian
package which contain the 'raku' executable:

    $ sudo apt install rakudo

Stop the currently running httpd:

    $ sudo apachectl graceful-stop

Obtain and install the source archives
--------------------------------------

Download and confirm the source packages:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku get

Unpack them into their own directory;

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku unpack

Configure the packages:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku config

Build and test the packages:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku build

Install the packages:

    $ sudo ./setup-apache2.raku install

Install apache2 from source and install in:
    /usr/local/apache2 # default

    cd into the source directory
    use the local script:
    $ ../apache2-config-user-openssl.sh x.y.za
    # note you may have to add your openssl version if it's not there already
    make && sudo make install
    sudo su
    apachectl -k graceful stop
    apachectl -k start

Post installation:
