Procedures for installing Apache2
=================================

NOTES:

The information in this directory applies specifically to installation
from source on a Debian 11 Bullsye amd64 host. Apache2 is not
well-documented and, while these instructions work for me, your
mileage may vary.

One prerequisite is the Raku programming language. If you know
you have it, you are all set. Otherwise, you can either (1) install 
the Debian packages which contain the 'raku' and 'zef' executables:

    $ sudo apt install rakudo zef

or (2) for a better experience install Raku and zef following
the instructions for the Raku Packages rakudo-pkg at Rakudo.org.

The user must ensure that the Raku module dependencies,
Text::Utils and JSON::Fast, are installed for the root user
as well as the the normal user. That can be done for
both if they are available in the Raku local site directory.
To confirm that run:

    # zef list --installed | grep 'Text::Utils'
    # zef list --installed | grep 'JSON::Fast''

Pre-installation preparation:
----------------------------

Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open

Ensure root has the necessary paths. Edit /root/.profile
and /root/.bashrc as follows:

Ensure you have the necessary Debian packages:

  as root execute bash script:
    $ sudo ./sh/install-debian-bullsye-apache2-prereqs.sh

Note OpenSSL 3.0.3 is currently not building for me
(as of 2022-06-05). Consequently I am building with
the libssl library package so, as root, you must
install it

    $ sudo aptitude install libssl-dev

Ignore the following OpenSSL section
for now.

=====================================
Building and using the latest OpenSSL
=====================================

Openssl testing requires a couple of Perl modules:

  as root execute:
    $ sudo cpanm Text::Template
    $ sudo cpanm Test::More

=====================================

Stop any currently running httpd:

    $ sudo apachectl graceful-stop

Note in the following examples only the 
unique leading letters of the commands need be
entered.

Obtain and install the source archives
--------------------------------------

Download and confirm the source packages:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku get

Unpack them into their own directory;

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku unpack

=====================================
IGNORE
Install OpenSSL first:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku config openssl
    $ ./setup-apache2.raku build  openssl
    $ sudo -s --preserve-env=PATH ./setup-apache2.raku install openssl
=====================================

Install Apache2 second:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku config apache
    $ ./setup-apache2.raku build  apache
    $ sudo -s --preserve-env=PATH ./setup-apache2.raku install apache

Post installation:
-----------------

I use an apache user and an apache group.
For convenience, I add my user name to the apache group.

My setup (your user and group numbers may vary):

/etc/passwd file:
  apache:x:108:65534::/home/apache:/usr/sbin/nologin

/etc/group file:
  apache:x:115:apache,myusername
