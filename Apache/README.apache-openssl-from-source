Procedures for installing Apache2
=================================

NOTES:

The information in this directory applies specifically to installation
from source on a Debian 11 Bullsye amd64 host. Apache2 is not
well-documented and, while these instructions work for me, your
mileage may vary.

Until I can find the correct solution, 
the user must ensure that the module dependencies,
Text::Utils and JSON::Fast, are installed for the root user
as well as the the user.

Pre-installation preparation:
----------------------------

Ensure root has the necessary paths. Edit /root/.profile
and /root/.bashrc as follows:

Ensure you have the necessary Debian packages:

  as root execute bash script:
    $ sudo ./install-debian-bullsye-apache2-prereqs.sh

One more prerequisite is the Raku programming language. If you know
you have it, you are all set. Otherwise, you can install the Debian
packages which contain the 'raku' and 'zef' executables:

    $ sudo apt install rakudo zef

Stop any currently running httpd:

    $ sudo apachectl graceful-stop

Note in the following examples only the 
unique leading letters of the commands need be
entered.

Obtain and install the source archives
--------------------------------------

Download and confirm the source packages:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku get

Unpack them into their own directory;

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku unpack

Install OpenSSL first:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku config openssl
    $ ./setup-apache2.raku build  openssl
    $ sudo -s --preserve-env=PATH ./setup-apache2.raku install openssl

Install Apache2 second:

    $ ./setup-apache2.raku config apache
    $ ./setup-apache2.raku build  apache
    $ sudo -s --preserve-env=PATH ./setup-apache2.raku install apache

Post installation:
