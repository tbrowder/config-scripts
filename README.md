# config-scripts

NOTE: This is a work-in-progress (WIP) and may be incomplete or
inoperative!

This is a collection of configuration scripts for my web server stack:
Apache, OpenSSL, Cyrus SASL, Postfix, PostgreSql, PCRE, etc.

Use the 'get-src.pl6' script to download the source
packages. (Requires Perl 6; see <http://perl6.org> for installation
instructions.
