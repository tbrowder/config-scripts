  # the current directory.
1-install-rakudo-star.sh
  # An install script to be run from inside the directory created
  #   by the previous script. 
  # The script will install the Perl 6 files, along with a
  #   a collection of useful modules, into directory:
  #     /opt/rakudo.d
  # The script will also output a script to be sourced top
