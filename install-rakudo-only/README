This package is used to completely install a complete Rakudo-only
distribution into a desired site-wide location controlled by
the root user.

The installation also adds an apprpriate script into /etc/profile.d
to add the approriate rakudo paths to the PATH environment variable
for all users.

Note that, after a first installation, the installing user must log
out and log in again to ensure access to rakudo binaries.

For updated installations, the original structure is retained and
new versions of files over-write old versions. No consideration
is made for any file that may no longer be used since we assume
the distribution archive is idempotent.

After an installation, a separate script is used to install or
update zef, the recommended module installer, and then read
a list of publicly-available modules to install or update.
